		<dd>Arkane Lyon has made an excelent game, that is
            exclusive to PlayStation. The protagonist is 
            wonderfully voice acted, as well as the rest of the
            cast. Downsides are how repetitive the gameplay
            loop can be, but I definitely recommend the game!</dd>
	<dt class="category">Far Cry 6 [Game] (6/10)</dt>
		<dd>The game is very fun, but lacks any good story filled with
            political agenda. As I said, the game is very fun, and I
            enjoyed my time, but the story was filled with modern politics.
            As I said, I had a lot of fun, but the story was disappointing.</dd>
	<dt class="category">Guardians of the Galaxy [Game] (8/10)</dt>
		<dd>This game is awesome plain and simple. It is a very short experience,
            but I enjoyed every minute of it. The combat was fun, the characters
            expertly acted, and the story took a different, compelling direction
            than the MCU did. I fully recommend this game.</dd>
    <dt class="category">Hawkeye Ep. 1-2 [Show] (6.5/10)</dt>
		<dd>Episodes one and two are great so far. They have a lot of backstory,
            and they ended abruptly, but I still really enjoyed what was presented.
            I can't give a definitive review of the show since it is not all out, but I
            recommend a watch!</dd>
