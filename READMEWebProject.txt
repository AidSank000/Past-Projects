My Web Project was created using Visual Studio Code. The main reference I used was the work we did in class using teh Fishcreek files. 
I also recieved help from Professor Oetken. I will comment and say that when uploading this file, some files used in this project were removed.
I would have had to haev removed them, but I don't remember when. One way I could have improved my project is to add better CSS. It seems very rough
and baseline right now. It isn't a professional make and looking at the site reflects that.
