This is the project I did in my Studio class last year. It is almost identical to my Web Project since my final project in Studio built off my 
project in Web Fundementals. References I used were Professor Oetken, Fishcreek files, and Dr. G. I learned the baseline of creating a website and how much
code it actually takes to make a small simple site. This project has the same issues as my Web Project, that it is very baseline and simple. Better CSS and design
would have chaned the site for the better. It looks cheap and too simple.
