MY final project file is from my Computing Principles class. The references I used were from Professor Harding and https://p5js.org/reference/. 
I learned a lot of programming during this project and I had fun doing it. We sued P5.js fr this assignemnt. I learned the basics of programming a game and how complex
it is. I struggleda lot with displaying the images in the game, but by the end it worked out alright. Over testing out the game, I made little tweaks and fixes to the 
round difficulty and meteor speed. One thing I would have added is to add a score board at the end which saved high scores. I also thought of a cool boss round at the 
end, but I decided it was too much to do before the projects end date.
